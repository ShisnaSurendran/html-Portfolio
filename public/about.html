I've worked extensively with platforms like Salesforce, Freshdesk, Zendesk, and Leadsquared. These tools have not only enhanced my operational efficiency but have also allowed me to create more meaningful and seamless customer experiences.</p>

<p>I've also developed a knack for data analysis, thanks to my proficiency in Excel and my growing understanding of SQL. Data-driven decision-making has become a cornerstone of my approach to problem-solving, allowing me to make more informed choices in the fast-paced world of Edutech.</p>

<p>Web development allows me to fuse my analytical skills with my creative side. I'm drawn to the idea of building digital experiences, shaping user interfaces, and creating solutions that enhance the online world. With each line of code I write, I'm constantly learning and evolving, and I can't wait to see where this journey takes me.</p>
<p>So, here's to a future filled with innovation, problem-solving, and creativity in the realm of web development. I'm excited to share my progress and experiences with you, and I hope you'll join me on this exciting new chapter of my professional life.</p>
